# MCP Remote Server Integration Debug Log

## Problem Statement
AIVA was unable to execute tools from remote MCP servers. The QuickBooks MCP server at `https://officeadmin.io/mcp/qb/sse` was returning empty `{}` responses instead of actual tool results.

## What We Tried (That Didn't Work)

### 1. Initial Debugging Attempts
- **Added extensive logging to ServerController.swift** (line 1121)
  - Added: `print("üé≠ [ServerController] Tool \(params.name) returned value: \(value)")`
  - Result: Could see tools were being called but returning empty objects
  - Issue: This was the wrong file - ServerController handles local AIVA tools, not remote server integration

### 2. Wrong File Focus
- **Spent significant time on RemoteServer.swift thinking it was just UI testing code**
  - Reality: RemoteServer.swift IS the actual remote server integration code
  - RemoteServerService class implements the Service protocol for remote servers
  - Already properly integrated via `computedServiceConfigs` in ServerController

### 3. Server Configuration Issues
- **Thought remote servers weren't configured in AIVA**
  - Programmatically added QuickBooks server to AIVA preferences using Swift script
  - Added: `ServerEntry(name: "QuickBooks", url: "https://officeadmin.io/mcp/qb/sse")`
  - Result: Server appeared in settings but tools still returned `{}`

### 4. MCP Protocol Implementation Fixes
- **Fixed SSE endpoint discovery**
  - Original: Directly POST to /messages endpoint
  - Fixed: GET /sse endpoint first to retrieve session-specific /messages URL
  - Added proper parsing of SSE response: `data: /mcp/qb/messages?sessionId=...`

- **Fixed SSE response parsing in initialization**
  - Added parsing of `event: message\ndata: {...}` format
  - Added `InitializeResult` struct with proper Decodable conformance
  - Extract JSON from SSE data lines during initialize response

- **Fixed initialized notification format**
  - Tried: `"method": "notifications/initialized"` (per some MCP specs)
  - Tried: `"method": "initialized"` (simpler format)
  - Added proper `params` field structure
  - Result: Server still responded with "Bad Request: Server not initialized"

### 5. Manual Protocol Testing
- **Extensive curl testing of the QuickBooks server**
  ```bash
  # Get session endpoint
  curl -X GET https://officeadmin.io/mcp/qb/sse -H "Accept: text/event-stream"
  # Returns: data: /mcp/qb/messages?sessionId=...
  
  # Initialize
  curl -X POST "https://officeadmin.io/mcp/qb/messages?sessionId=..." \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{...}}'
  # Returns: event: message\ndata: {"result":...}
  
  # Send initialized notification
  curl -X POST "..." -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialized","params":{}}'
  # Returns: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32000,"message":"Bad Request: Server not initialized"}}
  ```

### 6. Protocol Version Attempts
- **Tried different MCP protocol versions**
  - "2025-03-26" (latest)
  - "2024-11-05" (legacy)
  - Various client info configurations
  - Different capabilities structures

### 7. Compilation Fixes
- **Fixed Decodable conformance errors**
  - `EmptyParams?` doesn't conform to `Decodable`
  - Changed to `[String: String]?` for capabilities.tools
  - Fixed missing struct definitions

## Current Status

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **AIVA MCP connection** - Can communicate with AIVA via MCP tools
2. **Remote server discovery** - AIVA correctly loads custom servers from preferences
3. **Service integration** - RemoteServerService properly integrated via computedServiceConfigs
4. **SSE endpoint discovery** - Correctly gets session URLs from /sse endpoint
5. **Basic tool listing** - Remote servers appear in AIVA's tools view

### What's Still Broken ‚ùå
1. **Tool execution** - Remote tools return `{}` instead of actual results
2. **Server initialization** - QuickBooks server rejects all "initialized" notifications
3. **Protocol compliance** - Server appears to have non-standard MCP implementation

## Root Cause Analysis

The QuickBooks MCP server at `https://officeadmin.io/mcp/qb/sse` appears to have a **non-standard MCP implementation**:

1. **Accepts initialize requests** and returns proper SSE responses
2. **Rejects ALL initialized notifications** with "Server not initialized" error
3. **May require different protocol sequence** than standard MCP specification
4. **Possibly expects custom headers or timing** not documented in standard MCP

## Next Steps

1. **Research server-specific protocol** - This server may need reverse engineering
2. **Try different MCP test servers** - Verify AIVA integration works with standard servers
3. **Contact server maintainer** - Get documentation for this specific implementation
4. **Implement fallback handling** - Gracefully handle non-compliant servers

## Files Modified

1. `/App/Services/RemoteServer.swift`
   - Fixed SSE endpoint discovery (lines 108-140)
   - Fixed SSE response parsing (lines 175-210)
   - Fixed initialized notification format (lines 231-236)
   - Added InitializeResult struct (lines 43-56)

2. `/App/Controllers/ServerController.swift`
   - Added tool execution logging (line 1121)

3. User preferences
   - Added QuickBooks server to customServers AppStorage

## Key Learnings

1. **AIVA already had proper remote server integration** - we just needed to configure servers
2. **Different MCP servers may have non-standard implementations** - protocol compliance varies
3. **SSE transport requires careful response parsing** - can't just treat as regular JSON
4. **Some servers may need custom protocol handling** - one-size-fits-all doesn't work
